            <p>
                Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other devices when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a &quot;session
                cookie&quot;) or for multiple repeat visits (using a &quot;persistent cookie&quot;).
            </p>
            <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they expire when you close the web browser.</p>
